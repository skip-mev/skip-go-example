# Simple Skip Go Client Integration with Next.js

This is a simple example of the `@skip-go/client` in a a Next.js app. This is a good template or reference for a quick start integration.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

An API key is reccomended but not required to run this example. Learn more how to [request API keys](https://docs.skip.build/go/general/api-keys).

To add you API key populate the `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
SKIP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Proxying Skip API endpoint

To keep your API key secure and private, we recommend that you proxy the API requests from the frontend to your own backendâ€”where you can add your API key in the header before forwarding the request to the Skip Go API.

A guide to do so can be found [here](https://docs.skip.build/go/general/api-keys#setup-a-proxy-to-receive-skip-go-api-requests-and-add-the-api-key).
